So I'm making a dashboard app to make some of my daily tasks easier to accomplish.

One of the components of the dash is easy access to YouTube. This repo is for that component, which is a custom version of the YouTube interface without the guff and populated only with a choice bit of content I want to consume.

I'm going to be implementing Redux in this project, but for now I make use of my own proprietary system called "DISPATCHER" to handle bug tracking and setting state.

Thanks!
